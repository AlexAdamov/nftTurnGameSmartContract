# NFT Turn based game - Smart Contract

This a turn based game where the goal is to beat a Boss called Nagativo by sending him good vibes :-). 
Users mint an NFT player Character from 9 character types then proceed to the Arena to challenge Negativo. Each hit by the playing character is reciprocated by a hit from the Boss. 
A player has the ability to heal other players who may have created a playing character as well.
